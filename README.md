# BLE Satellite
This is a firmware repository for a Seeedstudio XIAO nRF52840 based solar satellite. You can find the documentation for this project on my website [here.]( https://www.bhoite.com/sculptures/ble-satellite/)

## Required libraries:
 - LCD library: [CDM4101](https://www.hexpertsystems.com/LCD/lcd.zip)
 - BLE: [Adafruit Bluefruit](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_BluefruitLE_nRF51)
 - Sensor: [Adafruit SHT31](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SHT31)
 - Memory: [Adafruit Flashtransport](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_SPIFlash/tree/master)

You'll need to install the above libraries on you Arduino IDE first. I used the Arduino IDE v1.8.13 to compile and flash the code on to the nRF52840. Other versions may or may not work.
